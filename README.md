# Seattle Music Scene

A website for aggregating information about all open mics and shows in Seattle
in one place.

Website is live at https://seattlemusicscene.info

# Dev Setup

Get the code!
 ```bash
 git clone git@github.com:<USERNAME>/sms.git
 ```

## Server Setup

Then, we setup the server side of things. The server runs on Python Version=3.9,
so to install packages correctly we need to be running that version of python.
Either [venv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)
works for this.

Once you have a Python 3.9 environment setup, we can install the necessary libraries from
the `requirements.txt` file provided in the `sms_server` directory.

```bash
cd sms/sms_server/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, we need to setup a `local_settings.py` file that should live next to the
`settings.py` file. The full path from root: `sms/sms_server/sms_server/local_settings.py`.
This is for various configuration settings and keys that shouldn't be
committed directly to the repo.

> [!NOTE]
> To get functional api keys reach out to me, I guess.

Here's what that file should look like =>

```python
"""Local Settings. DONT COMMIT THESE YOU FUCK."""

BANDSINTOWN_APP_ID = "REDACTED"
EVENTBRITE_TOKEN = "REDACTED"
TICKET_MASTER_API_KEY = "REDACTED"
TIXR_CLIENTS = [
  ("Nectar Lounge", "748", "REDACTED"),
  ("High Dive", "749", "REDACTED")
]
MEDIA_ROOT = "/Some/local/path/of/your/choosing"
IS_PROD = False
```

This is a necessary first step to run `manage.py` commands because
otherwise the `settings.py` file will be sad.

Now we can get our db setup!

```bash
# Create the DB and stuff
python manage.py migrate
# Give ourselves admin access!
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

At this point we can check our work by running the server, and trying to access
the admin page or any of the rest api endpoints.

```bash
# Run the server!
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

The admin panel is located at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) and you can
browse the rest api by looking at [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api)

Right now everything should be empty!
We can fix that by running management commands to import data.

> [!WARNING]
> You need functional api keys to import data.
> Also the api import takes ~45 minutes.

```bash
# 1. Import all data from the automatic apis!
python manage.py import_api_data --all
# 2. Import all data from the cralwers!
python manage.py crawl_data --all
# 3. Generate open mic night events!
python manage.py generate_open_mic_events
# 4. Write the data to a flat file used by the frontend!
python manage.py write_latest_data
```

Now we should be able to see some data in both the admin panel and the rest api!
Huzzah!

### Crawlers

There are venues that don't use any ticketing apis, and for these there are manual
crawlers written to extract their data (in `sms_server/api/ingestion/crawlers`).
Crawlers require some special setup to work properly, since they are dynamic code
that requires awareness of a particular venue in the DB. Crawlers attempt to find
their corresponding venue automatically based on a venue name regex in the crawler:

Each time a crawler is invoked, it will attempt to match itself with the corresponding venue.
When matched successfully it will create a `VenueApi` object with

1. The appropriate venue attached.
2. The Api Name set to "Crawler"
3. The Crawler Name set to the exact name of the crawler file.

Here's an example record for the crawler for Blue Moon Tavern:

## Frontend Setup

A **MUCH** easier process:

```bash
cd sms_frontend
npm run dev
```

## Celery Setup

```bash
# 1. Running celery beat. Must be run from the sms/sms_server folder.
celery -A sms_server beat -l DEBUG
# 2. Running the celery worker. Must be run from the sms/sms_server folder.
celery -A sms_server worker -l DEBUG
# 3. Running the backend. Must be run from the sms/sms_server folder.
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
# 4. Running the frontend. Must be run from the sms/sms_frontend folder.
npm run dev
```
